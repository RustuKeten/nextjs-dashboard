## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

My main purpose is to learn what is the new feature came with next.js 14, and to display the redux usage to my audiences.
Additionally I want to improve my typescript and tailwind skills as well.
This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course.
It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
